## Lifetimes
- Every reference in rust has a Lifetimes that is being inferred by compiler
- Lifetime is a scope for which that reference is valid
- Most of the time lifetime is implicit and inferred 
- The main of lifetime is to prevent dangling references

### Borrow Checker
- Rust compiler has borrow Checker
- And every borrow checkker compares the multiple scope to determine whether all borrows are valid

### Lifetime Elision
- Three rules
    - The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter thatâ€™s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)`; a function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)`; and so on.
    - The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`
    - The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.
